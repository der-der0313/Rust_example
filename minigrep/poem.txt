I’m the chairman of the Students’ Union. 
As the New Year is around the corner, 
we are going to hold a New Year party for you, 
which is intended to enable you to have a better understanding of Chinese culture.


During the party, 
not only can you sing a Chinese song, 
What’s more, 
You’ll learn at the party how to make dumplings. 
Sounds great.
 doesn’t it?
